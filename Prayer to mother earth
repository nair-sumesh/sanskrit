त्वं देव्यादिवराहेण रसाया: स्थानमिच्छता ।
उद्‌धृतासि नमस्तुभ्यं पाप्मानं मे प्रणाशय ॥




- O mother earth, you were raised by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of a boar because of your desiring to have a place to stay. I pray that you kindly vanquish all the reactions of my sinful life. I offer my respectful obeisances unto you.
